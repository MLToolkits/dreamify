HIGH:
0.  Remove eager tf execution to speed up dreams 
    - (don't rely on global vars and use tf vars with functional programming)
1.  Modularize and share code b/n dream and deepdream
2.  Implement class for ImageToVideo converter                                                  # DONE
3.  Implement optional backward loop for video                                                  # DONE
4.  Implement video framing for deep dream
5.  Handle unmatched dim sizes for dream                                                        # DONE
6.  Implement validators as decorators for dream and deepdream                                  # DONE
7.  Remove redundant or unnecessary type or numpy-tensor (and, vice versa) conversions
8.  Add more comments. Duhh
9.  Optimize loop of simple dream (seems to slowed down. YIKES!)


MEDIUM:
1.  Compare different pre-trained models in generation
2.  Optional seeded generations


LOW:
1.  Optimize cicd pipeline
2.  Update README
