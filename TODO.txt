HIGH:
1.  Modularize and share code b/n dream and deepdream
2.  Implement class for ImageToVideo converter                                                  # DONE
3.  Implement optional backward loop for video                                                  # DONE
4.  Implement video framing for deep dream                                                      # DONE
5.  Handle unmatched dim sizes for dream                                                        # DONE
6.  Implement validators as decorators for dream and deepdream                                  # DONE
7.  Remove redundant or unnecessary type or numpy-tensor (and, vice versa) conversions
8.  Add more comments. Duhh
9.  Optimize loop of simple dream (seems to slowed down. YIKES!)                                # DONE
10. Optimize video making by insteading of buffering (in sys memory), save octave by octave
        then concatenate the video (.mp4) files. N.b., keep the buffering method to support
        CPU-only runtimes


MEDIUM:
1.  Compare different pre-trained models in generation
2.  Optional seeded generations
3.  Remove color artifacts in generated shallow dream
14. Add option to choose layer settings


LOW:
1.  Optimize cicd pipeline
2.  Update README
3.  Implement progress bar (TQDM) in deep dream
