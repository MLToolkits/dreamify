HIGH:
1.  Modularize and share code b/n dream and deepdream
2.  Implement class for ImageToVideo converter                                                  # DONE
3.  Implement optional backward loop for video                                                  # DONE
4.  Implement video framing for deep dream                                                      # DONE
5.  Handle unmatched dim sizes for dream                                                        # DONE
6.  Implement validators as decorators for dream and deepdream                                  # DONE
7.  Remove redundant or unnecessary type or numpy-tensor (and, vice versa) conversions
8.  Add more comments. Duhh
9.  Optimize loop of simple dream (seems to slowed down. YIKES!)                                # DONE
10. Optimize video making by insteading of buffering (in sys memory), save octave by octave
        then concatenate the video (.mp4) files. N.b., keep the buffering method to support
        CPU-only runtimes
11. Adaptive frames to interpolate to ensure 30fps                                              # DONE
12. Modularize deepdream
13. Consider the mirror_video option on the duration by dividing the duration 
        by half (as mirroring doubles)
14. Support custom models and layers
15. Support gif creation
16. Legacify deep_dream_simple & deep_dream_octaved                                             # DONE

======================================================================================================

MEDIUM:
1.  Compare different pre-trained models in generation
2.  Optional seeded generations
3.  Remove color artifacts in generated shallow dream
4.  Add option to choose layer settings
5.  Simplify imports 
6.  Remove redundancy in ImageToVideoConverter by using the Factory design pattern
7.  Support single channel images via channel (C) repetition, 
        since pre-trained models expect RGB-Cs
8.  Pass max_dim to get_image
9.  Fix pathing support in save video

======================================================================================================

LOW:
1.  Optimize cicd pipeline
2.  Update README
3.  Implement progress bar (TQDM) in deep dream
