HIGH:
1.  Modularize and share code b/n dream and deepdream
2.  Implement class for ImageToVideo converter                                                  # DONE
3.  Implement optional backward loop for video                                                  # DONE
4.  Implement video framing for deep dream                                                      # DONE
5.  Handle unmatched dim sizes for dream                                                        # DONE
6.  Implement validators as decorators for dream and deepdream                                  # DONE
7.  Remove redundant or unnecessary type or numpy-tensor (and, vice versa) conversions
8.  Add more comments. Duhh
9.  Optimize loop of simple dream (seems to slowed down. YIKES!)                                # DONE
10. Optimize video making by insteading of buffering (in sys memory), save octave by octave     # DONE
        then concatenate the video (.mp4) files. N.b., keep the buffering method to support
        CPU-only runtimes
11. Adaptive frames to interpolate to ensure 30fps                                              # DONE BUT UNNEEDED
12. Modularize deepdream
13. Consider the mirror_video option on the duration by dividing the duration                   # DONE
        by half (as mirroring doubles)
14. Support custom models and layers
15. Support gif creation                                                                        # DONE
16. Legacify deep_dream_simple & deep_dream_octaved                                             # DONE
17. Dynamic image preprocessor based on the model
18. Implement class-based dream and deepdream

======================================================================================================

MEDIUM:
1.  Compare different pre-trained models in generation
2.  Optional seeded generations
3.  Remove color artifacts in generated shallow dream                                           # DONE
4.  Add option to choose layer settings
5.  Simplify imports                                                                            # PARTIAL
6.  Remove redundancy in ImageToVideoConverter by using the Factory design pattern              # UNNEEDED
7.  Support single channel images via channel (C) repetition, 
        since pre-trained models expect RGB-Cs
8.  Pass max_dim to get_image                                                                   # REQS: HIGH 18
9.  Fix pathing support in save video

======================================================================================================

LOW:
1.  Optimize cicd pipeline
2.  Update README
3.  Implement progress bar (TQDM) in deep dream
4.  Add license
